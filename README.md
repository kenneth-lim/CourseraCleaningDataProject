## About this repo

run_analysis.R contains code to do the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (mean frequency was included as well)
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (converts numeric representations to words)
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (lower case, no hyphens, no brackets)
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* The starting condition is with the UCI HAR dataset as a folder in the working directory.
